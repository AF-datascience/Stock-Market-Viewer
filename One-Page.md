# Stock Market Viewer

This is a one-pager covers a description of the project in human readable terms. Anyone should be able to understand this page to understand what the project will do. 

It starts with the describing the project, the problem we are trying to solve and what I want to do. 

## Stock Market Porfolio Tracker 

I want to create a way in which a person can track the performance of certain stocks over time which are in their personal portfolio.

Firstly, there should be a public landing page, which has a search bar for a non-logged in user to search for a company and their share information displayed. Thedefauly view should be a hardcoded company like AAPL. 

I also want to create a way for a user to sign up, with an email and password. Which can also be reset if they forget these. The user can also delete their account. 

Once a user is logged in, I want to them to be able to add stocks they search for in their favourites - this would be a page title favourites and would have information relating to those shares only. The user can also remove stocks from their favourites.

The favourites page would have some interesting things like a pie chart showing the porflio breakdown. I would also have a like a Proportional Area Chart these look quite nice. 

The above is the MVP of this project. 

The below is some additional features that I would also like to make:

Some other features that I want this app to have would be: 
1. create notifications of when the portfolio is up or down by a certain percentage by the days close - which runs on the NYSE Open-Close time. 
    - This is so a user can monitor performance. 
2. More financial information about the stocks in their portfolio - like P/E ratios, Debt, Assets and Free Cash Flow. Simple financial metrics. 
    - Have some charts of the above financial information and in tables so it's nice and easy for a user to get a more detailed look. 
3. There should be some relevant news article links that are occuring across each of the stocks like a banner running across the screen.
    - If they click a link to a news article it should redirect them, but still keep them logged in. 
4. There should be a performance over time metrics included from the inception of the persons portfolio favourites - this should reset if they remove a favourite company. 
5. There should also be a page of *Super Investors* like Warren Buffet, so that a user can compare themselves against them based on 13F Filings from the SEC.
