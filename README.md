# Stock Market Viewer - A Free Open Source Stock Market Portfolio Tracker

## A fully functional Stock Marcket Portfolio trakcer written in Python developed using Flask.

This project is designed as an alternative for the current stock market information websites. 

I came to this project idea as I was browsing Yahoo Finance viewing the price of certain stocks for fun, it's a great website that lets you view information surrounding a particular stock or asset class, but I felt the design was lackluster and could be improved. 

I also wanted to add some stocks or assets to my favourites so I could view them later. So thought it would be a good idea to create a web application in Python that does this. 

I've developed a simple workflow for how to build this project; 

1. One-Pager - An outline in simple terms of the projects goals
2. Workflow Diagram - Developed from the One-Pager to see milestones for an MVP
3. Task Breakdown - Task list for each of the elements defined in the Workflow Diagram
